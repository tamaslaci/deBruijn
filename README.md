# deBruijn
University project during my fourth year at ELTE
>Experimenting with the concept of the De Brujn graphs ("a directed graph representing overlaps between sequences of symbols"), using Python notebook with SageMath.
>If the vertexes are arranged around a circle and the edges are undirected then interesting graph forms can be found.
